"""
Implementation of several voting theoretic axioms 

We implement the following axioms
* Anonymity
* Weak anonymity (a weakening of the usual anonymity axiom)
* Neutrality
* Weak neutrality (a weakening of the usual neutrality axiom)
* Unanimity
* Condorcet
* Pareto
* Independence

An axiom is a function mapping a rule and a profile (in the sense of 
the `pref_voting` package) to a value  in {-1,1,0}, where 0 means the 
axiom is not applicable, -1 means the axiom is violated (applicable 
and false) and 1 means the axiom is satisfied (applicable and true). 

We also add an optional `sample` argument. If it is given, not all 
permutations are checked but only `sample`-many are randomly checked.

(Each axiom also has a continuous version which is described in 
`axioms_continuous.py`. These output real numbers describing the 
degree to which the axiom is satisfied (for use in optimization).)
